#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CXX_MINOPT
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Try to disable CXX compiler optimization(s). Macro based in part on
#   ax_cc_maxopt.m4. In order to allow for the user to override these
#   options and to avoid defaults imposed via AC_PROG_CXX, it is
#   important to include this macro *before* AC_PROC_CXX.
#
#   Requires macro(s): AX_COMPILER_VENDOR
