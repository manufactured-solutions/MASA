BASIC INFORMATION:
------------------

Welcome to MASA, the Manufactured Analytical Solutions Abstraction Library.

Check the EXAMPLES directory for examples of the MASA C++, C and Fortran API.
The source code is contained in src, and the regression tests are in tests.

------------------
BUILD INFORMATION:
------------------

MASA currently supports later versions of the GNU, Intel, and PGI
family of compilers.

Regression tests are routinely performed against the following
compiler versions:

PGI 11.5
GNU 4.5
Intel 11.1

------------------
TO BUILD:
------------------

1) ./bootstrap (from source, ignore if this is a release tarball)
2) ./configure --prefix= top-level dir
3) make
4) make install

It is recommended that new users run 'make check' This runs numerous diagnostic
tests, which ensure the precision of all associated solutions are at minimum,
10e-15.
