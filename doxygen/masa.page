\section overview Overview

The Groovy Toolkit (GRVY) is a library used to house various support
functions often required for application development of
high-performance, scientific applications.  The library is written in
C++, but provides an API for development in C and Fortran.  The
primary functionality provided by the library is categorized as
follows:

<ul>
<li>a flexible method for
parsing ascii-files input files (with backwards-compatibility support)
<li>a performance timing mechanism to provide a simple
summary of individual code section performance along with basic
statistics
<li> a simple priority-based logging mechanism to control application messages
<li> miscellaneous file handling and math utilities
</ul>

Thanks for your interest in libGRVY. To aid in usage, this manual is
further divided into the following subsections:

<ul>
<li> \subpage model "Library Overview"
<li> \subpage installation
<li> \subpage apiC "C/C++ Interface"
<li> \subpage apiF "Fortran Interface"
</ul>

/*! \page inputFile Example libGRVY Input File

This is an example input file for use with the libGRVY parsing mechanism.
Note that hehind the scenes, the library is using
the <a href="http://getpot.sourceforge.net/">GetPot</a> parsing tool
to provide a flexible parsing mechanism for C/C++ and Fortran.  Note
that the default comment delimiter is defined as the \# sign and
comments can begin at the beginning of a line or after a variable
declaration to aid in documenting the input file.  The parsing
mechansism is keyword driven and can be organized into multiple
sections.  Consequently, you are allowed to have variables of the same
name so long as they are within unique section definitions.  Note also
that because the parsing mechanism is keyword driven, the input
directives can be specified in \e arbitrary order.  There is no
requirement to maintain a specific variable declaration pattern.

<b>Important Note for Fortran Programmers</b> The input parser can
handle double precision input using standard C style notation;
however, it will not support Fortran's "d" delimiter. So, please specify
double precision values as \e 1.2345e6 as opposed to \e 1.2345d6.

/*! \page installation Installation/Linkage

libGRVY uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool)
for its development build system.  This system is popular among the
Linux development community and provides a familiar build environment
for end users.  

To build libGRVY starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution and
enter the top-level directory.

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 > tar xvfz grvy-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd grvy-$(VERSION)/            
</pre></div>

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

libGRVY requires that the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost C++
library</a> be available locally. If Boost is installed and available
within your default login environment, then libGRVY should automatically configure
against the available installation.  If, however, your Boost
installation is in a non-standard location, use
the <tt>--with-boost</tt> option to specify the location.

Since libGRVY provides a Fortran interface, a valid Fortran90 compiler is
also required.  To date, libGRVY has been successfully tested with \e
gfortran and the Intel \e ifort compilers.  The configuration step
will look for available compilers in the user environment but as with
any \e autoconf based configuration, these can be overridden with
command line arguments (by setting \c CXX, \c FC, and \c F77
appropriately).

<b>Installation Directory</b>: Use the <tt>--prefix</tt> option to
specify your desired top-level installation directory for GRVY.  The
examples below all configure libGRVY to be installed in the user's ~/bin/grvy
directory.

<em>Configure with Boost from default login environment:</em> <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy \endcode

<em>Or, configure with Boost from a specific directory:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy --with-boost=$MY_BOOST_DIR/boost-1.37.0 \endcode

<em>Or, configure with specific compilers:</em>        <br>

\code > ./configure CXX=g++ FC=ifort --prefix=$HOME/bin/grvy \endcode

<h2> Library Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If successful, this
will build the libGRVY library (static and dynamic versions) and several
examples.

\code > make \endcode

<b> Verifying the build:</b> To verify that the software is working
properly, a test option is provided to run a short suite of
functionality tests against the local build.  To run, issue a <tt>make
check</tt> to run the tests.  If successfull, output similar to the
following will be generated.

\code
 > make check

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue a <tt>make install</tt> to install
the library.  The installation will consist of three top-level
directories housing the library, include files, and
example files.  An example of the top-level directories after
installation is shown below:

\code > make install \endcode

Top-level libGRVY installation directory:

\code
 > ls $HOME/bin/grvy/
 examples/  include/  lib/
\endcode

<h2>Library Linkage</h2>

To link an external C/C++ or Fortran application with the library, the
\c include directory must be added to the compilers include search
path in order to access the grvy.h header file (or for Fortran, the \c
lib directory should be added to access the pre-compiled
grvy F90 module).  The \c lib directory should also be added
to the linker search path along with a request to link against the
libGRVY library.  Several example link steps are provided below.  These
examples assume that the libGRVY library has been successfully built and
installed previously in the users's ~/bin/grvy directory:

<h3>C/C++ Example</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode

<h3>Fortran Example</h3>

\code > $(FC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/lib app.f90 -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode

To embed the dynamic library search path for the libGRVY library
directly into the application executable, use an additional linker
option as follows:

<h3>C/C++ Example</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib \
         -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode


<b>Important Note:</b> F90 module file formats are not consistent
across multiple compilers. Therefore, a Fortran application and the libGRVY
F90 interface \em must be built with the same Fortran compiler family to ensure
compatibility.
